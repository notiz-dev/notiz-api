Hi there,

umm (_awkward silence_) you may have noticed we have been quiet with our newsletter (yet). But wait we got some news...

We're excited to finally launch our **Newsletter** üòé (better late than never!?). Thank you all for being patient with us. It has already been 1 and a half years ü§Ø since we started [notiz.dev](https://notiz.dev) back in **March 2020**.

Thanks to you it has been an **amazing** journey for us. A lot has happened since we started and here is a quick recap ‚è™

### What have we been up to?

- Building notiz.dev with [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Scully](https://scully.io/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Comments section with [giscus](https://giscus.vercel.app/) and GitHub Discussions
- Hosting a workshop about [Building REST APIs with NestJS and Prisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmbd5hcQUaY) at Prisma Day 2021
- Published Open Source libraries
  - [scully-plugins](https://github.com/notiz-dev/scully-plugins) Various Scully plugins (RSS Feed, lazy-images, medium-zoom)
  - [ngx-tailwind](https://github.com/notiz-dev/ngx-tailwind) Angular schematics to initialize Tailwind CSS
  - [nestjs-prisma](https://notiz.dev/blog/nestjs-prisma-schematics) Nest library and schematics to add Prisma integration
  - [prisma-dbml-generator](https://notiz.dev/blog/prisma-dbml-generator) Visualize Prisma Schema as Entity-Relationship Diagram


We can't wait to see the evolution of web development in the coming years and we will try to be a part of it.

### What we are working on?

We have been hard at work improving our blog content. Recently, we have added "Shortcodes" to our content which allows us to **embed** Angular component right in our markdown. You might have seen "Shortcodes" in action with the Code Block with Tabs, GitHub Repo and article cards.

Here is a little sneak peak for you. Checkout [Shortcodes for Angular](https://shortcodes.notiz.dev) if you are interested in creating interactive Angular components for your markdown content.

Checkout our **Latest Posts** below üëá and our [**Open Source**](https://github.com/notiz-dev) libraries on GitHub.

Your notiz.dev Team

Psst! We snuck a **preview** post in for you, see below üëá
