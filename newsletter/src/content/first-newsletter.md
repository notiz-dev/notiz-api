Hi there,

umm (_awkward silence_) you may have noticed we have been quiet with our newsletter (yet). But wait we got some news...

We're excited to finally launch our **Newsletter** üòé (better late than never!? ). Thank you all for being patient with us. It has already been 1 and a half year ü§Ø since we started [notiz.dev](https://notiz.dev/?utm_campaign=first-newsletter&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email) back in **March 2020**.

Thanks to you it has been an amazing journey for us,

A lot has happened since we started and here is a quick recap ‚è™

### What have we been up to?

- Building notiz.dev with [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Scully](https://scully.io/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Comments section with [giscus](https://giscus.vercel.app/) and GitHub Discussions
- Hosting a workshop about [Building REST APIs with NestJS and Prisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmbd5hcQUaY) at Prisma Day 2021
- Open Source...

We can't wait to see the evolution of web development in the coming years and we will try to be a part of it.

### What we are working on?

We have been hard at work improving our blog content. Recently, we have added "Shortcodes" to our content which allows us to embed any Angular component right in our markdown. You might have seen the Code Block with Tabs, GitHub Repo and article cards. 

Here is a little sneak peak for you. Checkout [Shortcodes for Angular](https://shortcodes.notiz.dev/?utm_campaign=first-newsletter&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email) if you are interested in creating interactive Angular components for your Markdown content. 

Checkout our **Latest Posts** below üëá and our [**Open Source**](https://github.com/notiz-dev) libraries on GitHub.
